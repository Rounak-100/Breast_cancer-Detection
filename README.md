# Multimodal Breast Cancer Classification
## Proposed Approach
The proposed framework performs multimodal breast cancer classification by integrating ultrasound, histopathological, and chest X-ray MSI images. Each modality is processed using a dedicated pretrained CNN backbone augmented with a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance spatial and channel-wise feature representations. The extracted modality-specific features are projected into a shared embedding space and fused using a gated cross-attention mechanism, which dynamically regulates inter-modal information flow. The fused representation is used for binary classification of benign/normal and malignant cases.
